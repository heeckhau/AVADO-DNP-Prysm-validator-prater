                            The AVADO Hardware has to run 24/7. If it is not properly connected to electricity or your
                            router and therefore the internet, it will not work. While unlikely, potential hardware
                            failures may result in slashing.<br />

                            I am using AVADO on my own behalf and my own risk, and I accept that software and hardware
                            bugs may result in me being slashed.

                            During the onboarding which follows - choose a complex password for protecting the Web-UI  which is at least <b>8 characters long</b>, contains at least <b>1 capital letter</b>, <b>1 number</b> and <b>1 special character</b> without too many repeating characters and no common words. 
                            <br/>If your password does not meet the prysm backend criteria, the on boarding will fail when attempting to enter your wallet password in the last step and you'll need to start over with a different password which meets the criteria.

                            This is a Prysm bug that will be fixed by the team in a next release.
